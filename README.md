This is a java program for the client and server with a real-time communication using socket. It implements TCP/IP server.
To run these programs, you need to have java and jdk installed on your pc. https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp
For this program to run, you need to open the directory containing these files and open two command prompts, one for the client and server.
While on the directory, type this command to run the code, "java Server.java" and on the other cmd type "java Client.java" and you should have the server and client communicating.
However, if you may want to have two different computers communicating together, all you need is to change the "localhost" on the client program on line 8 to the IP address of the server computer. 
NB: For #5, the computers must be on the same network. 
Happy coding!
